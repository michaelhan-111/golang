This script/program was created for the following reason(s): 
- To automate notifications to slack and emails 

Pre-Requisites: 
- Email integration has been added to the slack room(s) that are being informed. Slack email integration steps: https://slackhq.com/email-meet-slack-slack-email

Use/rules: 
- The configuration file is in the same directory as the script. The location of the configuration file is hardcoded in the script. 
- To update yaml, follow the structure that's currently in place. Any modifications will require code updates, which can be done. 

Gotchas/Notes: 
- Email is being sent via gmail mail servers; they're reliable so I decided to use them.
